a variable holds either a primitive type or reference to an object		17SpB2a class name can be used as a type to declare an object reference variable	"String<type> title<object reference, stores address>;"	17SpB2an object reference variable holds the address of an object		17SpB2the object itself msust be created separately		17SpB2Generally we use  the new operator to create an object	"title = new String (""Java"");"	17SpB2creating an object is called instantiation 		17SpB2an object is an instance of a particular class		17SpB2"Once an object has been instantiated, we can use the dot operator to inoke its methods"	count = title.length()	17SpB2"A method may return a value, which can be used in an assignment or expersion"		17SpB2a method invocation can be thought of as asking a object to perform a service		17SpB2"Once a String object has been created, neither its value nor its length can be changed"	it is considered immutable	17SpB2math method	"Math.max(num1, num2)"	17SpB2All boolean operators have lower precedence than the relational operators		17SpB2 a switch statement will evaluate to a value 		17SpB2
